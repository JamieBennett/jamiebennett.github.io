      <description>Why update? We all know what software updates are, we see them all the time on our phones, tablets, desktops and servers. They appear as pop-ups, in the message of the day (motd), and even have dedicated applications extolling their necessity, and all for good reason. Having out of date software often means, at best a degraded user experience, at worst a security hole exploitable by hackers. When you consider that analysts such as Gartner predict that the IoT will connect over 20 billion devices by 2020 the necessity for a clean and crisp update mechanism becomes paramount to any device.</description>

      <description>Internet of Things (IoT) devices have come a long way over the last couple of decades. In 1996 I remember being in complete awe at turning on a light from my Pentium II-based desktop computer using X10 and being equally frustrated when I switched on the microwave and the same light turned off. In equal parts it marveled and disappointed and to top it off it wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly cheap. Fast-forward a couple of decades and IoT is the new buzz-word, previously know as Ubiquitous Computing, Pervasive Computing, and a whole host of other buzz words but in short what it really means is our &amp;lsquo;things&amp;rsquo;, our devices, our environments, are all getting smarter.</description>
