      <description>There are a wide range of solutions on the market today to help the avid gardener with their plants, some are low tech battery-less meters designed to give you a simple view of how your plant is doing, others are much more high-tech (and expensive). Two of the most important variables to monitor in a greenhouse are temperature and humidity, too hot and plants start to scorch and wilt, too cold and they can be damaged, and humidity is important for a whole host of plants you may find in a greenhouse.</description>

      <title>Using Snaps on Raspbian</title>

      <description>Who isn&amp;rsquo;t a fan of the Raspberry Pi? The little, cost-effective single-board computer that has so many uses, in fact at home I have 4 doing various things from monitoring temperature and humidity in my greenhouse to serving up a dashboard interface for my home automation solution, both projects which I will write more about in future posts. But what makes the Raspberry Pi even better, well Snaps of course.</description>

      <title>Spotify as a Snap, putting the developer in control</title>

      <description>Just before Christmas Canonical announced that the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular music streaming service, Spotify, is now available as a Snap, but what makes this significant I hear you ask? Well Spotify and many other developers are choosing a new way of delivering software to Linux users and Snaps are at the forefront.
One of the important aspects of Snaps is not so much about the technology, but more about where the software comes from.</description>

      <title>Why software updates matter, especially in the world of IoT</title>
      <link>www.linuxuk.org/post/updates-in-the-iot-world/</link>

      <description>Why update? We all know what software updates are, we see them all the time on our phones, tablets, desktops and servers. They appear as pop-ups, in the message of the day (motd), and even have dedicated applications extolling their necessity, and all for good reason. Having out of date software often means, at best a degraded user experience, at worst a security hole exploitable by hackers. When you consider that analysts such as Gartner predict that the IoT will connect over 20 billion devices by 2020 the necessity for a clean and crisp update mechanism becomes paramount to any device.</description>

      <title>snap try: The quick way to package snaps</title>
      <link>www.linuxuk.org/post/snap_try/</link>

      <description>This weeks snippet is all to do with improving the snap developer experience.
Since the release of snapd 2.0.8 we have added one of the most useful tools for snap developers:
snap try
What this does is effectively mounts any folder containing an unpackaged snap at /snap/snapname as a writeable folder allowing quick iteration during the packaging process. No longer do you have to create a read-only squashfs snap and install it to try out your latest changes and this speeds up the workflow tremendously.</description>

      <title>Are snaps really cross distro?</title>
      <link>www.linuxuk.org/post/cross-distro-snaps/</link>

      <description>Yesterday we announced the new home for everything snaps and Snapcraft, snapcraft.io, and at the same time made available the cross-distribution work that really does means snaps can run on virtually any Linux distribution. Today we have enabled support for Debian, Arch, Gentoo, Fedora, and of course Ubuntu and all its flavours but enabling more including OpenSUSE, CentOS, Elementary, Mint, OpenWrt and others is in the works.
The announcements was met with a mostly positive response which, given that Linux packaging has been an issue for so many people and for so long, is hardly surprising.</description>
